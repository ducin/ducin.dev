                Different Meaning of the same Phrase
              </a>
            </h2>
            <p><a href="ddd-talk-to-domain-experts">Yesterday</a> we&#39;ve been speaking to three different domain experts and gathered quite some knowledge about how the warehousing business operates.</p>
            <p>You must have noticed that all three people below were using the <em>stock item</em> phrase, but each with a different meaning:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the Head of the Inventory Department: <em>something available in stock</em>,</li>
              <li>the Order Fulfillment Manager: <em>something to be sent away to the customer</em>,</li>
              <li>and the Returns and Claims Supervisor: <em>something returned by a customer</em>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We must also realize all these three people probably work on different teams, maybe even departments, and certainly have different tasks and priorities.</p>

            <h2 id="speaking-the-same-language-within-a-given-business-context">
              <a href="#speaking-the-same-language-within-a-given-business-context">

                Speaking the same Language within a given business context
              </a>
            </h2>
            <p>However, we&#39;re here to create a system which will help run our company. At some point certain development teams will have to start communicating with a certain domain experts. They will form a <strong>multi-disciplinary teams including: development and domain expert - together</strong>. Working on a specific part of the business.</p>
            <p>The domain expert will answer tens or hundreds of questions related to . The <strong>expert</strong> will be using his professional terminology: the <em>business language</em>. On the other hand, <strong>developers</strong> might also use their own professional dev terminology. As a consequence, a <strong>new language emerges</strong> naturally.</p>
            <p>The domain expert is the one who brings expertise. Most probably the <em>business language</em>, the <em>industry standards</em>, etc. would heavily influence this <strong>common language</strong>.</p>
            <p>It&#39;s called the <em>Ubiquitous Language</em> (<em>UL</em>).</p>

            <h2 id="what-39-s-the-point-of-that-new-lingo">
              <a href="#what-39-s-the-point-of-that-new-lingo">
                <span class="header-link"></span>
                What&#39;s the point of that new Lingo?
              </a>
            </h2>
            <p>The point is that <strong>each domain-relevant phrase, used within UL, carries important meaning</strong>.</p>
            <p>It does take quite significant time until the domain expert transfers domain knowledge to developers. Once a complex topic is explained, a <strong>new term</strong> gets coined (or a business term is simply reused). <strong>We use it to communicate faster</strong>.</p>
            <p>That&#39;s it - use 2-3 words without the need to explain the whole topic using 5 sentences. Without doing that <strong>again</strong>! We have already discussed that before, right? <strong>Using highly specialized terminology makes communication more effective</strong>.</p>
            <p>In DDD we call that domain-related meaning: <strong>semantics</strong>.</p>

            <h2 id="bounded-context-and-ubiquitous-language">

                Bounded Context and Ubiquitous Language
              </a>
            </h2>
            <p>We&#39;ve said that the team of both developers and domain experts are working on a <em>specific part of the business</em>. This work includes understanding the business, designing the solution and often implementing it eventually (however, not always).</p>
            <p>
              <strong>This &quot;<em>part of business</em>&quot; is extremely important and in DDD is called a <em>Bounded Context</em></strong
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the sake of the moment (just a temporary simplification), you can think of a <em>Bounded Context</em> as something that might get eventually <strong>implemented as software <em>module</em>, but <em>bounded</em></strong
              >. It&#39;s logically <strong>separated</strong> from the rest of the solution. <strong>The boundary is semantics.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Again, we&#39;ve got totally different meanings (<strong>semantics</strong>) of what a <em>stock item</em> means in different <strong>contexts</strong>. <strong>Different Bounded Contexts</strong>.</p>
            <p>The boundary is defined by the language used (<strong>Ubiquitous Language</strong>). If a given phrase carries the exact same meaning, it means it&#39;s within the same context:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>🔥🔥🔥 same meaning &lt;=&gt; same context 🔥🔥🔥</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>And yet, if a given phrase could have different meanings, it means we&#39;re dealing with more than one Bounded Context:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>🔥🔥🔥 different meaning &lt;=&gt; different context 🔥🔥🔥</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The &quot;<em>Bounded</em>&quot; word denotes a boundary. Since all this is <strong>about meaning and language</strong>, the boundary is a <strong>semantic boundary</strong> or <strong>linguistic boundary</strong>.</p>
            <p>You can think - and actually you should - that all these:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Ubiquitous Language</strong> - the language used</li>
              <li><strong>Bounded Context</strong> - the part of the business being worked on</li>
              <li><strong>semantic boundary / linguistic boundary</strong> - the boundary separating the bounded context from the rest of the solution they are all <strong>very closely connected</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>This is absolutely the core of DDD</strong>. But don&#39;t worry if you haven&#39;t grasped it all at once. We will <a href="/ddd-designing-bounded-context">tackle Bounded Contexts in DDD more tomorrow</a>.</p>
            <p>Anyway, let&#39;s get back to the hero of today - the Ubiquitous Language.</p>

            <h2 id="whether-you-want-it-or-not">
              <a href="#whether-you-want-it-or-not">
                <span class="header-link"></span>
                Whether you want it or not
              </a>
            </h2>
            <p><strong>It&#39;s not your choice to speak the language or not.</strong></p>
            <p>While working on a team, you have to communicate with others <em>somehow</em>. The <strong>domain-relevant phrases are being used anyway</strong>.</p>
            <p>Our duty is to make this language more universal - use it:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>while discussing stuff,</li>
              <li>while coding backend,</li>
              <li>while coding frontend,</li>
              <li>while writing or executing tests and so on.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The language is used everywhere: code, docs, discussions, etc. But watch out: <strong>everywhere within the Bounded Context</strong>.</p>

            <h2 id="ubiquitous-language-is-local-not-global">
              <a href="#ubiquitous-language-is-local-not-global">
                <span class="header-link"></span>
                Ubiquitous Language is local, not global
              </a>
            </h2>
            <p>A quite common <strong>misconception</strong> is treating UL as something that is global to the whole company. That&#39;s essentially <strong>not the case with UL</strong>.</p>
            <p>Introducing a globally spoken set of domain relevant phrases would require potentially crazy amounts of effort to unify the language. A question arises: how big your company is? How many people would have to align? How many people would have to get trained in order to speak a globally-acclaimed language?</p>
            <p>Imagine synchronizing terminology across codebases of different teams. Madness...</p>
            <p>I hope you can see that&#39;d be pure nonsense 😉.</p>
            <p>UL - being spoken within the Bounded Context, and only within that Bounded Context - is something that happens naturally. You don&#39;t need to control the process. It will emerge anyway.</p>

            <h2 id="specific-language-makes-the-team-more-autonomous">
              <a href="#specific-language-makes-the-team-more-autonomous">

                Specific Language makes the team more Autonomous
              </a>
            </h2>
            <p>Moreover, DDD makes sense especially when dealing with complex businesses. And scaling complex businesses is hard... That&#39;s also where a context-specific language helps.</p>
            <p><strong>Using different Ubiquitous Languages, each within different context, makes them more autonomous</strong>.</p>
            <p>Also, since the business is not set in stone (it will change), then the UL would evolve, within time. And that&#39;s great - the changes made to UL of one context will affect another context in no way. 🥰</p>
            <p><strong>That&#39;s the point.</strong></p>

            <h2 id="does-it-mean-we-39-d-have-3-different-code-stockitem-code-classes">
              <a href="#does-it-mean-we-39-d-have-3-different-code-stockitem-code-classes">
                <span class="header-link"></span>
                Does it mean we&#39;d have 3 different <code>StockItem</code> classes?
              </a>
            </h2>
            <p>Potentially, yes. But <strong>that&#39;s not a problem</strong>.</p>
            <p>If you&#39;re concerned about violating the DRY principle, please let me remind you that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY is not about code, but about knowledge</a> (again, <strong>semantics</strong>!):</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                &quot;<em>Every piece of <strong>knowledge</strong> must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system</em>&quot;. ― Andy Hunt, Dave Thomas in &quot;<em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em>&quot;
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Hunt and Thomas didn&#39;t relate to DDD <em>explicitly</em>, but their <strong><em>knowledge</em> is the same concept as <em>semantics</em> in DDD.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, <strong>if the <em>stock item</em> means three different things in three different contexts, they&#39;re not the same things.</strong> If you provide 3 <code>StockItem</code> classes, you&#39;re not copying semantics/knowledge. Essentially, <strong>you&#39;re not violating the DRY principle</strong>.
            </p>

                Make the Language Ubiquitous
              </a>
            </h2>
            <p>The only thing you should care is to <strong>use it pragmatically</strong>.</p>
            <p>One way to be pragmatic with UL is to use only one phrase for exactly one concept. <strong>Don&#39;t introduce synonyms</strong>. In UL, if two different phrases are used - it has to mean two <strong>semantically different</strong> concepts. And vice versa, one phrase should relate to a single concept. Just this.</p>
            <p>Again - only within the team. We don&#39;t care about terminology outside.</p>

            <h2 id="how-is-that-useful">
              <a href="#how-is-that-useful">
                <span class="header-link"></span>
                How is that useful?
              </a>
            </h2>
            <p>Each word we say carry meaning (<strong>semantics</strong>!). When naming a class, the <strong>class name brings information</strong> about its responsibility, usage, etc. Meaningful names make it easier to reason about the code.</p>
            <p>These all are perfect places to use UL:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>if you&#39;re coding frontend components - use UL.</li>
              <li>if you&#39;re implementing E2E test, use UL.</li>
              <li>if you&#39;re writing docs - same, <strong>use UL</strong>, and so on.</li>
            </ul>

            </h2>
            <p>Let&#39;s switch to a different domain: <strong>e-commerce</strong> this time.</p>
            <p>In a typical online shops we can buy <em>products</em>.</p>
            <p>When we navigate through our account we can see our order history. There, we can see the <em>products</em> we bought.</p>
            <p>The shop could have introduced some rebates or discounts, e.g. based on previous purchases. Wait, what did I buy? Yes, a <em>product</em>.</p>
            <p>And finally, after I paid, the package has been successfully delivered (<em>product</em>!) to my place. The system sends an email notification asking me to rate... the <em>product</em>.</p>
            <p>Oh, <strong>products everywhere</strong>! Yes, but in each context it has, again, different meaning:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>product as an <em>offer</em> (something I could buy)</li>
