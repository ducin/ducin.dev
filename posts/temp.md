## DDD terminology and jargon

Having said all of that, it's worthwhile to mention a minor "_bad practice_" related to all this jargon: it could be overwhelming. Especially for people not familiar with DDD. **And all those fancy terms and phrases are not the core themselves**. What matters way more is, again, collaboration with domain experts in order to understand the domain better.

In order to reduce the DDD jargon, you can substitute e.g. _domain_ with _business_ and _bounded context_ with _module_. Of course it's less precise, but does it matter, as long as we make developers shift their focus to understanding the... umm, _business_, in order to properly draw the... _modules_? Overusing the jargon is nothing but gatekeeping - be careful for that.

Kudos to [Oskar Dudycz](https://event-driven.io/en/) who convinced me that reducing jargon pays off.

> but... but I do understand how my product and business work. I know who the customers are, how does the company make the revenue, and all. I do create business-oriented software. Is that DDD?

Um, "*it depends*". It could be (to some extent at least), it could be not.

# plan

- in practice: e.g. different semantic models
- overview: strategic and tactical
- exploring domains, heuristics
- MFE x Bounded Contexts
- Atomic Design x DDD
- mistakes:
  - jumping straight into tactical phase
  - canonical data models (ignoring different semantics)
  - database-driven development (reflect DB schema everywhere)
- practices:
  - event storming
  - domain storytelling
  - domain story mapping
  - Wardley mapping
- tactical
