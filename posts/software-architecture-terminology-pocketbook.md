This document briefly describes dozens of **important software architecture** topics, terms, acronyms, strategies, characteristics, and so on. It shows the **relations** between them and outlines **how endlessly interdisciplinary Software Architecture is**.

## Motivation

Why writing yet another pile of descriptions? ðŸ¤”

There's a quite a lot of high quality materials out there (as well as low quality, unfortunately). But software architecture is a multi-disciplinary field that integrates the knowledge from various domains... and when you want to learn one concept, 3 new ones pop up! Each of these bring more and more concepts we should learn first. And as we go down the rabbit hole, we get to [know our unknowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_unknown_unknowns). **But this can be intimidating**.

The purpose of this Pocketbook is to introduce each term in **the simplest possible form**.

**Each definition is just 1 sentence.** It's very far from a detailed analysis, it doesn't cover all possible usecases, especially it doesn't cover edge cases. It's just a very high-level description, often including the **WHY**: why would someone use a certain tool or adapt a technique.

I believe this will make it easier for developers to **enter the world of Software Architecture** in a less painful.

I hope that below you'll find lots of **inspirations for further learning**.

Enjoy the read!

## Software Architecture Terminology

<% TOC %>

### Abstraction Leak

An Abstraction Leak is when internal details, concepts and limitations **are being exposed instead of hidden away**; it occurs when the underlying implementation details of a module or component are unintentionally exposed to the outside world, breaking the abstraction barrier and leading to tight coupling, dependencies, and potential issues when making changes or updates.

See: [Anti-patterns](#anti-patterns), [Abstraction](#abstraction). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) allows to **make future developers understand _WHY_ a decision has been made in a given context**; it is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences, providing a record of the motivations behind the decision, the alternatives considered, and the trade-offs involved, to help maintain a shared understanding of the system design over time.

See: [Architecture Documentation](#architecture-documentation), [C4 Model](#c4-model), [RFC](#rfc-request-for-comments). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Aggregate

An Aggregate is a **cluster of domain objects** that can be treated as a single unit; the most important pattern in tactical DDD; it is a collection of related entities and value objects that are bound together by a root entity, which acts as a gateway to the aggregate, ensuring consistency and encapsulation of domain logic within the boundary of the aggregate

See: [DDD](#ddd-domain-driven-design). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Amdahl's Law

Amdahl's Law is a formula that illustrates the **potential speedup** of a task from **parallel processing**, stating that the maximum improvement is limited by the fraction of the task that cannot be parallelized; as such, **improvements diminish as the non-parallelizable portion becomes more significant**.

See: [Principles](#principles), [Parallelism](#parallelism), [Concurrency](#concurrency), [Performance](#performance). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Anemic Domain Model

An Anemic Domain Model (or Anemic Entity) is an **anti-pattern** where the domain model classes have **barely any behavior** (only data properties) and are **separated from the business logic** (which is placed outside, e.g. in services); it allows important **domain rules and behavior to _leak_** and be implemented in different, often random places, hence **lacking encapsulation** and **cohesion**, eventually leading to being tough to maintain, test, and evolve**.

See: [DDD](#ddd-domain-driven-design), [Anti-patterns](#anti-patterns), [Encapsulation](#encapsulation), [Domain Model](#domain-model), [Abstraction Leak](#abstraction-leak), [Cohesion](#cohesion), [Entity](#entity). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Anti-patterns

_An antipattern is just like a pattern, except that instead of a solution it gives something that looks superficially like a solution but isn't one._

### API Contract

An API Contract **defines how providers and consumers communicate**; it's a specification including the expected behavior, inputs, outputs, and constraints of an API; either formalized in a contract file (e.g. OpenAPI/Swagger, Pact, RAML) or informally (un)documented.

See: [API](#api-application-programming-interface), [Web Services](#web-services), [Bounded Context](#bounded-context), [ACL](#acl-anti-corruption-layer), [Consumer-Driven Contracts](#consumer-driven-contracts), [Versioning](#versioning), [Contract Testing](#contract-testing). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Architecture Documentation

Documenting architecture involves creating detailed representations and descriptions of a system's structure, components, and interactions to communicate design decisions, guide development, and facilitate future maintenance and understanding among stakeholders

See: [Software Architecture](#software-architecture), [C4 Model](#c4-model), [ADR (Architecture Decision Record)](#adr-architecture-decision-record), [RFC](#rfc-request-for-comments). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Backoff

Backoff is waiting until you try again; it's a technique used to manage retries in an application control flow or network communication, where a system waits for an increasing amount of time after each failed attempt before trying again, helping to reduce network congestion and avoid overwhelming resources.

See: [Resilience](#resilience), [Backpressure](#backpressure). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Backpressure

Backpressure is a mechanism to control the flow of data being sent from the producer to the consumer from becoming overloaded, when the consumers cannot keep up, helping to prevent resource exhaustion and maintain overall system stability, in a lossy or lossless manner.

See: [Resilience](#resilience), [Reactivity](#reactivity), [Rate Limiting](#rate-limiting), [Backoff](#backoff), [Circuit Breaker](#circuit-breaker-pattern), [Client-Server Model](#client-server-model). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

See: [Off-the-shelf Software](#off-the-shelf-software). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Brooks' Law

_Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later._

> &#45; Fred Brooks

Brooks' Law states that adding more people to a late software project will only make it later, due to the time required for new team members to learn the project, communicate effectively, and coordinate work, leading to diminishing returns and increased complexity, rather than accelerating progress.

See: [Principles](#principles), [Team Topologies](#team-topologies). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### C4 Model

The C4 Model allows to document systems from **different perspectives** and for **different audiences**; it is a framework for visualizing software architecture via hierarchical diagrams on 4 different levels: Context, Containers, Components, and Code, in order to help teams understand and communicate the system's structure and relationships effectively.

See: [Architecture Documentation](#architecture-documentation), [ADR (Architecture Decision Record)](#adr-architecture-decision-record), [RFC](#rfc-request-for-comments). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Chaos Engineering

Chaos Engineering is about breaking things on purpose and seeing what has collapsed; it's a discipline that proactively introduces (repetetively) controlled failures and disruptions into a system to test its resilience, identify weaknesses, and improve recovery mechanisms, enabling teams to improve system robustness and reliability by understanding how the system behaves under adverse conditions.

See: [Resilience](#resilience), [Software Testing](#software-testing), [Fault Injection](#fault-injection). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

The Circuit Breaker Pattern disallows to kick someone who's currently down; it's a a Fault Tolerance mechanism which detects failures and prevents further requests from being sent to the failing service, thus avoiding overload while recovering, and retrying e.g. after a timeout (then passing requests normally).

See: [Microservices](#microservices), [Rate Limiting](#rate-limiting), [Backpressure](#backpressure), [Backoff](#backoff). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Client-Server Model

The Client-Server Model is a computing architecture (or structure) where tasks and responsibilities are divided between clients and servers, with clients requesting services or resources from servers, which process and fulfill these requests.

See: [Web Services](#web-services), [Frontend](#frontend), [Web Services](#web-services), [HTTP](#http-hypertext-transfer-protocol), [RPC](#rpc-remote-procedure-call), [API](#api-application-programming-interface). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### CMS (Content Management System)

A Content Management System (CMS) is a software application that allows users to create, manage, and publish digital content, such as websites, blogs, or documentation, without requiring technical expertise, providing tools for content editing, collaboration, and version control.

See: [Off-the-shelf Software](#off-the-shelf-software). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Code Coverage

Code Coverage is a set of metrics measuring the **percentage of code executed within automated tests** (and **percentage of code not taking part in any tests whatsoever**), saying nothing about the tests _quality_, their goals, feature/business process coverage or the overall _effectiveness_ of the tests.

See: [Software Testing](#software-testing), [Goodhart's Law](#goodharts-law). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Consistency

Consistency is the state of a system where all data is the same across all nodes in a **distributed system**, ensuring that **all nodes see the same data at the same time**, and that changes are propagated correctly and in a timely manner, to maintain data integrity and reliability.

See: [Strong Consistency](#strong-consistency), [Eventual Consistency](#eventual-consistency), [CAP Theorem](#cap-theorem-consistency-availability-partition-tolerance), [ACID Transactions](#acid-transactions-atomicity-consistency-isolation-durability), [BASE Transactions](#base-transactions-basically-available-soft-state-eventually-consistent). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Context Mapping

Context Mapping is about **integrating different Bounded Contexts**; it' i's a strategic design technique in DDD that helps in **identifying and managing the relationships and interactions between different Bounded Contexts**, by defining explicit boundaries, communication models, and translation mechanisms, to ensure consistency and alignment between different models and teams; the term is slightly unfortunate, as** it's not about mapping but about aligning and integrating**.

See: [DDD](#ddd-domain-driven-design). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Conway's Law

_[O]rganizations which design systems (in the broad sense used here) are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations._

> &#45;â€ŠMelvin E. Conway, _How Do Committees Invent?_

Conway's Law states that organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structures; it suggests that the architecture of a software system will reflect the social structure of the organization that produced it, and vice versa, highlighting the importance of aligning team structures with system architecture to improve collaboration and productivity.

See: [Principles](#principles). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Correlation ID

A Correlation ID is a **unique identifier** that gets **attached to each request** made to a distributed system, allowing for easier tracking and correlation of logs and events, and enabling the troubleshooting of issues across multiple services.

See: [Distributed Systems](#distributed-systems), [Microservices](#microservices), [Observability](#observability). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### CRM (Customer Relationship Management)

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a technology for managing a company's relationships and interactions with current customers and potential customers, typically using data analysis to improve business relationships, customer satisfaction, retention, and sales growth, through personalized communication and targeted marketing

See: [Off-the-shelf Software](#off-the-shelf-software). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Cynefin Model

The Cynefin Model helps to identify how difficult a problem is and which strategy to apply; it is a decision model which helps to understand the nature of a given problem or situation, categorizing it into one of five domains: **Simple, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic, and Disorder**, to guide decision-making and problem-solving approaches based on the characteristics of the context.

See: [Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition](#dreyfus-model-of-skill-acquisition). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Databases

_Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves._

### DDD (Domain Driven Design)

Domain-Driven Design is about **focusing on the business domain** first and foremost, instead of technical details; it highly **discourages using unified/universal models** in favor of **breaking the domain into multiple subdomains**, each having their own **specific model, language, and context**, ensuring that each is highly specialized, according to the business needs and knowledge gathered from **domain experts**.

See: [Software Architecture](#software-architecture), [Strategic DDD](#strategic-ddd), [Tactical DDD](#tactical-ddd), [Bounded Context](#bounded-context), [Heuristics](#heuristics), [Ubiquitous Language](#ubiquitous-language), [Context Mapping](#context-mapping), [Core Domain](#core-domain), [Subdomain](#subdomain), [Generic Subdomain](#generic-subdomain), [Supporting Subdomain](#supporting-subdomain), [Entity](#entity), [Anemic Domain Model](#anemic-domain-model), [Value Object](#value-object), [Aggregate](#aggregate), [Aggregate Root](#aggregate-root), [Domain Event](#domain-event), [Domain Service](#domain-service), [Repository](#repository), [Policy](#policy), [ACL](#acl-anti-corruption-layer), [Shared Kernel](#shared-kernel), [Business Archetype](#business-archetype), [Business Process](#business-process), [Business Rule](#business-rule), [Invariant](#invariant), [Event Sourcing](#event-sourcing), [Event Storming](#event-storming), [CQRS](#cqrs-command-query-responsibility-segregation). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Defensive Programming

Defensive Programming is about **expecting the unexpected**; it is a coding practice that anticipates and guards against potential failures, errors, and exceptions, by validating inputs, handling edge cases, and implementing error-checking mechanisms, to ensure robustness, reliability, and fault tolerance in software applications.

See: [Resilience](#resilience), [Design For Failure](#design-for-failure), [Fault Tolerance](#fault-tolerance), [Chaos Engineering](#chaos-engineering), [Isolate Failure](#isolate-failure). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Derivation

See: [Inheritance](#inheritance), [Abstraction](#abstraction), [Reactivity](#reactivity). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Design For Failure

Designing for failure assumes that things will break inevitably and a system needs to be ready for it upfront; it is a proactive approach in software architecture where each element is expected to fail, and incorporates various strategies to maintain functionality and minimize downtime, such as: graceful degradation, failovers, redundancy, chaos engineering, observability and many more.

See: [Resilience](#resilience), [Graceful Degradation](#graceful-degradation), [Failover](#failover), [Redundancy](#redundancy), [Fault Tolerance](#fault-tolerance), [Chaos Engineering](#chaos-engineering), [Circuit Breaker](#circuit-breaker-pattern), [Monitoring](#monitoring), [Observability](#observability), [Distributed Tracing](#distributed-tracing). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### DevOps

DevOps is caring not only about the **coding phase**, but also **everything that happens next**; it's a cultural and technical movement that combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops), aiming to automate and integrate software development, testing, deployment, and monitoring processes to enhance efficiency, accelerate delivery, and improve overall software quality.

See: [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration), [Continuous Deployment](#continuous-deployment), [Continuous Delivery](#continuous-delivery), [Observability](#observability), [Monitoring](#monitoring), [DORA metrics](#dora-metrics). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Distributed Monolith

A Distributed Monolith is an architectural anti-pattern which takes **the worst of both worlds** (Monoliths, Distributed Systems); it's a system that is **split into multiple services** (distributed) along with all its complexity and other downsides but still exhibits the same characteristics and problems as a monolith (usually unintentionally designed to be deployed as a whole) such as tight coupling, shared data, and dependencies, leading to complexity, performance issues, and maintainability challenges, despite being distributed across multiple services.

See: [Microservices](#microservices), [Monolith](#monolith), [Modulith](#modulith), [Anti-patterns](#anti-patterns), [Fallacies of Distributed Computing](#fallacies-of-distributed-computing). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Distributed Tracing

Distributed Tracing allows to see how a user's **request travels throughout the entire system**; it is a technique used to monitor and troubleshoot the flow of each requests across various Microservices in a Distributed System, capturing timing data and dependencies to identify performance bottlenecks and enhance overall system observability, where a single user's request gets identified and tracked across entire system using a Correlation ID.

See: [Distributed Systems](#distributed-systems), [Microservices](#microservices), [Performance](#performance), [Observability](#observability), [Monitoring](#monitoring), [Correlation ID](#correlation-id). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### DORA metrics

DORA metrics express **how fast can you ship or rollback**; they are key performance indicators used to assess the effectiveness of software delivery and operational performance, focusing on four dimensions: deployment frequency (DF), lead time for changes (LTC), mean time to restore service (MTTR), and change failure rate (CFR), helping teams improve their DevOps practices.

See: [DevOps](#devops), [Fitness Functions](#fitness-functions). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition

The Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition describes the five stages of learning a new skill: Novice, Advanced Beginner, Competent, Proficient, and Expert, highlighting the progression from following rules to intuitive decision-making, and the importance of experience, practice, and feedback in skill development.

See: [Kolb's Learning Cycle](#kolbs-learning-cycle), [Law of Triviality (Bikeshedding)](#law-of-triviality-bikeshedding), [Cynefin Model](#cynefin-model), [Unknown Unknowns](#unknown-unknowns). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is a software development principle that promotes **reducing repetition and redundancy** in code, by **extracting common logic into reusable components**, functions, or modules, to improve consistency and maintainability; however when **misunderstood** (or taken to extreme) it leads to **over-abstraction**, making the codebase more complex and harder to understand

See: [Principles](#principles), [WET](#wet-write-everything-twice). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### DTO (Data Transfer Object)

A Data Transfer Object (DTO) is an object with **only the data, and no logic** (methods); it carries data between processes or services, typically used to encapsulate and disallow leaking abstraction of one module to another.

See: [Web Services](#web-services), [DDD](#ddd-domain-driven-design), [Entity](#entity), [Value Object](#value-object), [ACL](#acl-anti-corruption-layer), [Encapsulation](#encapsulation), [Abstraction Leak](#abstraction-leak). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Entity

An Entity is a **distinct and identifiable object** (which has an ID and changes within time, unlike a _Value Object_) in a domain model; it represents a real-world concept with a **unique identity**, properties, and behavior, and is typically used to model core business objects that have a long lifespan and require **persistent** state, such as users, products, or orders.

See: [DDD](#ddd-domain-driven-design), [Anemic Domain Model](#anemic-domain-model), [Value Object](#value-object), [Aggregate](#aggregate), [Bounded Context](#bounded-context), [Ubiquitous Language](#ubiquitous-language), [ACL](#acl-anti-corruption-layer). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)

See: [Off-the-shelf Software](#off-the-shelf-software). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### ESB (Enterprise Service Bus)

An Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) is an **old-school** way to implement service-oriented architecture (SOA), relatively **expensive**, introduces a **centralized** bus which other services/applications can integrate e.g. through standardized data exchange, thus looses coupling between them, but also becomes a single point of failure and a bottleneck.

See: [SOA](#soa-service-oriented-architecture), [Single Point of Failure](#single-point-of-failure), [Bottleneck](#bottleneck). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Failover

Failover is the process of **switching to a redundant or standby system** when the primary system fails, ensuring continuous operation and minimal disruption to services.

See: [Resilience](#resilience), [Design For Failure](#design-for-failure), [Fault Tolerance](#fault-tolerance). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Fallacies of Distributed Computing

The Fallacies of Distributed Computing are a set of assumptions that developers often make about distributed systems, including beliefs like "the network is (always) reliable" and "latency is zero," which can lead to misdesign and failures; recognizing these fallacies helps in creating more resilient applications.

See: [Distributed Systems](#distributed-systems), [Resilience](#resilience), [Microservices](#microservices), [Network Protocols](#network-protocols), [Failover](#failover). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Fault Injection

Fault injection is a testing technique where errors or failures are deliberately introduced into a system to evaluate its behavior under stress, helping developers identify vulnerabilities, assess recovery mechanisms, and improve overall system reliability and fault tolerance.

See: [Resilience](#resilience), [Software Testing](#software-testing), [Chaos Engineering](#chaos-engineering), [Fault Tolerance](#fault-tolerance). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Fault Tolerance

Fault Tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating correctly even in the event of a failure or error, typically achieved through redundancy, error detection, and recovery mechanisms to ensure uninterrupted service.

See: [Resilience](#resilience), [Design For Failure](#design-for-failure). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Fitness Functions

Fitness functions allow to measure how a given system achieves **high-level goals**; they are metrics used to evaluate how well an existing system's architecture meets specified requirements or goals, guiding design and development decisions by providing quantitative feedback on performance, reliability, and other critical attributes.

See: [Software Architecture](#software-architecture), [DORA metrics](#dora-metrics). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Frontend

The frontend is the part of a software application that users interact with directly, typically through a user interface, such as a web browser or mobile app, enabling users to view and interact with content, data, and services, and providing a way to input data, perform actions, and receive feedback.

### Gall's Law

_A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system._

> &#45; John Gall

Gall's Law suggests that successful complex systems are typically built from simpler, functioning prototypes, rather than attempting to design and implement complex systems from scratch

See: [Principles](#principles). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### God Class

A God Class (also an object, component, interface etc) is a class that **knows too much or does too much**; it's an anti-pattern where a single class becomes overly complex, bloated, and takes on too many responsibilities (hence significantly strengthening **tight coupling**), violating the Single Responsibility Principle and making the codebase harder to maintain, test, and understand; e.g. a **User class being reused across various different modules**, yet supporting all of them, thus knowing a little bit about each module, eventually being unmanageable because of tight coupling.

See: [Anti-patterns](#anti-patterns), [Bounded Context](#bounded-context), [Domain Model](#domain-model), [Legacy Code](#legacy-code). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Goodhart's Law

_When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure._

> &#45; Charles Goodhart

Goodhart's Law states that when a measure becomes a target, it loses its effectiveness as a measure, as people will optimize for the target rather than the underlying goal, leading to unintended consequences, distortions, and gaming of the system.

See: [Principles](#principles), [Code Coverage](#code-coverage). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Heuristics

Heuristics are **rules of thumb** that help in making decisions; they are practical guidelines or strategies that are not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect, but are useful in **problem solving** and decision-making under uncertainty or with limited information; usually multiple heuristics are combined to make a decision.

See: [DDD](#ddd-domain-driven-design), [Subdomain](#subdomain), [Bounded Context](#bounded-context). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Hofstadter's Law

_It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law._

See: [Principles](#principles). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of web communication, defining how clients (like browsers) and servers exchange information over the internet, using requests and responses to retrieve or send data, typically operating over TCP and supporting methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for interacting with resources.

See: [Network Protocols](#network-protocols), [Web Services](#web-services), [Client-Server Model](#client-server-model), [REST](#rest-representational-state-transfer), [SOAP](#soap-simple-object-access-protocol), [RPC](#rpc-remote-procedure-call), [Webhook](#webhook). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Invariant

An **Invariant is a condition that must always be true**, regardless of the state of the system; it is a rule or constraint that should never be violated, ensuring the correctness and consistency of the system.

See: [Reactivity](#reactivity), [DDD](#ddd-domain-driven-design), [Business Rule](#business-rule). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Isolate Failure

Isolating failure is about **preventing a single failure from cascading**, even from taking the whole system down; it is a design principle that aims to contain and limit the impact of failures by isolating components, services, or processes, to prevent them from affecting the entire system, ensuring that failures are contained and do not propagate.

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) is a design principle that suggests keeping systems, processes, or solutions **as simple as possible**, **avoiding unnecessary complexity**, features, or components, to improve clarity, maintainability, and usability, and reduce the risk of confusion or errors.

See: [Principles](#principles). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Kolb's Learning Cycle

Kolb's Learning Cycle is a four-stage model of experiential learning that includes: Concrete Experience (having a direct experience), Reflective Observation (reviewing and reflecting on the experience), Abstract Conceptualization (learning from the experience), and Active Experimentation (applying the new knowledge), emphasizing learning through a continuous, iterative process.

See: [Legacy Code](#legacy-code). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### TTM (Time To Market)

Time To Market (TTM) describes how fast can you ship stuff; it's the time it takes to develop and launch a new product or feature, from the initial idea to its availability to customers, and is a critical factor in a company's success, as it directly impacts competitiveness, revenue, and market share.

See: [MVP](#mvp-minimum-viable-product). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Underfetching

Underfetching happens when an API doesn't provide enough data in a single request, requiring the client to make additional requests to fetch the necessary information, leading to performance issues and increased latency, commonly seen in REST APIs when the response doesn't include all required data for a specific view or business operation.

See: [Web Services](#web-services), [GraphQL](#graphql), [Overfetching](#overfetching), [REST](#rest-representational-state-transfer), [Performance](#performance), [HTTP](#http-hypertext-transfer-protocol), [Latency](#latency). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Unknown Unknowns

_Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, **there are known knowns**; there are things we know we know. We also know there are **known unknowns**; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also **unknown unknowns** â€” the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones._

### Upstreams and Downstreams

**Upstream is the source**/provider of data, events (or even git commits) etc, while **Downstream is the destination / consumer / subscriber etc; Downstream directly depends on the upstream, forming a unidirectional data flow

See: [Reactivity](#reactivity). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Value Object

A Value Object **represents a domain-related value along with its logic without having any identity**; having no identity (no ID property, **unlike an _Entity_**) means that Value Objects cannot change over time, have no lifecycle, hence are **immutable**, making them ideal to be reused in memory across different objects having the same value (as they cannot change); examples: a `skill` in a HR system, `money` in a financial system etc.
