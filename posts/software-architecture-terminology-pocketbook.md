This document briefly describes dozens of **important software architecture** topics, terms, acronyms, strategies, characteristics, and so on. It shows the **relations** between them and outlines **how endlessly interdisciplinary Software Architecture is**.

## Motivation

Why writing yet another pile of descriptions? ðŸ¤”

There's a quite a lot of high quality materials out there (as well as low quality, unfortunately). But software architecture is a multi-disciplinary field that integrates the knowledge from various domains... and when you want to learn one concept, 3 new ones pop up! Each of these bring more and more concepts we should learn first. And as we go down the rabbit hole, we get to [know our unknowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_unknown_unknowns). **But this can be intimidating**.

The purpose of this Pocketbook is to introduce each term in **the simplest possible form**.

**Each definition is just 1 sentence.** It's very far from a detailed analysis, it doesn't cover all possible usecases, especially it doesn't cover edge cases. It's just a very high-level description, often including the **WHY**: why would someone use a certain tool or adapt a technique.

I believe this will make it easier for developers to **enter the world of Software Architecture** in a less painful.

I hope that below you'll find lots of **inspirations for further learning**.

Enjoy the read!

## Software Architecture Terminology

<% TOC %>

### Abstraction Leak

An Abstraction Leak is when internal details, concepts and limitations **are being exposed instead of hidden away**; it occurs when the underlying implementation details of a module or component are unintentionally exposed to the outside world, breaking the abstraction barrier and leading to tight coupling, dependencies, and potential issues when making changes or updates.

See: [Anti-patterns](#anti-patterns), [Abstraction](#abstraction). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) allows to **make future developers understand _WHY_ a decision has been made in a given context**; it is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences, providing a record of the motivations behind the decision, the alternatives considered, and the trade-offs involved, to help maintain a shared understanding of the system design over time.

See: [Architecture Documentation](#architecture-documentation), [C4 Model](#c4-model), [RFC](#rfc-request-for-comments). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Amdahl's Law

Amdahl's Law is a formula that illustrates the **potential speedup** of a task from **parallel processing**, stating that the maximum improvement is limited by the fraction of the task that cannot be parallelized; as such, **improvements diminish as the non-parallelizable portion becomes more significant**.

See: [Parallelism](#parallelism), [Concurrency](#concurrency), [Performance](#performance). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Anti-patterns

_An antipattern is just like a pattern, except that instead of a solution it gives something that looks superficially like a solution but isn't one._

### Architecture Documentation

Documenting architecture involves creating detailed representations and descriptions of a system's structure, components, and interactions to communicate design decisions, guide development, and facilitate future maintenance and understanding among stakeholders

See: [Software Architecture](#software-architecture), [C4 Model](#c4-model), [ADR (Architecture Decision Record)](#adr-architecture-decision-record), [RFC](#rfc-request-for-comments). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Backoff

Backoff is waiting until you try again; it's a technique used to manage retries in an application control flow or network communication, where a system waits for an increasing amount of time after each failed attempt before trying again, helping to reduce network congestion and avoid overwhelming resources.

See: [Resilience](#resilience), [Backpressure](#backpressure). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Backpressure

Backpressure is a mechanism to control the flow of data being sent from the producer to the consumer from becoming overloaded, when the consumers cannot keep up, helping to prevent resource exhaustion and maintain overall system stability, in a lossy or lossless manner.

### Brooks' Law

_Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later._

> &#45; Fred Brooks

Brooks' Law states that adding more people to a late software project will only make it later, due to the time required for new team members to learn the project, communicate effectively, and coordinate work, leading to diminishing returns and increased complexity, rather than accelerating progress.

See: [Team Topologies](#team-topologies). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### C4 Model

The C4 Model allows to document systems from **different perspectives** and for **different audiences**; it is a framework for visualizing software architecture via hierarchical diagrams on 4 different levels: Context, Containers, Components, and Code, in order to help teams understand and communicate the system's structure and relationships effectively.

See: [Architecture Documentation](#architecture-documentation), [ADR (Architecture Decision Record)](#adr-architecture-decision-record), [RFC](#rfc-request-for-comments). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Chaos Engineering

Chaos Engineering is about breaking things on purpose and seeing what has collapsed; it's a discipline that proactively introduces (repetetively) controlled failures and disruptions into a system to test its resilience, identify weaknesses, and improve recovery mechanisms, enabling teams to improve system robustness and reliability by understanding how the system behaves under adverse conditions.

See: [Resilience](#resilience), [Software Testing](#software-testing), [Fault Injection](#fault-injection). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

The Circuit Breaker Pattern disallows to kick someone who's currently down; it's a a Fault Tolerance mechanism which detects failures and prevents further requests from being sent to the failing service, thus avoiding overload while recovering, and retrying e.g. after a timeout (then passing requests normally).

See: [Microservices](#microservices), [Rate Limiting](#rate-limiting), [Backpressure](#backpressure), [Backoff](#backoff). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

See: [Off-the-shelf Software](#off-the-shelf-software). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### ESB (Enterprise Service Bus)

An Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) is an **old-school** way to implement service-oriented architecture (SOA), relatively **expensive**, introduces a **centralized** bus which other services/applications can integrate e.g. through standardized data exchange, thus looses coupling between them, but also becomes a single point of failure and a bottleneck.

See: [SOA](#soa-service-oriented-architecture), [Single Point of Failure](#single-point-of-failure), [Bottleneck](#bottleneck). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Failover

Failover is the process of **switching to a redundant or standby system** when the primary system fails, ensuring continuous operation and minimal disruption to services.

See: [Resilience](#resilience), [Design For Failure](#design-for-failure), [Fault Tolerance](#fault-tolerance). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Fallacies of Distributed Computing

See: [Resilience](#resilience), [Design For Failure](#design-for-failure). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Fitness Functions

Fitness functions allow to measure how a given system achieves **high-level goals**; they are metrics used to evaluate how well an existing system's architecture meets specified requirements or goals, guiding design and development decisions by providing quantitative feedback on performance, reliability, and other critical attributes.

See: [Software Architecture](#software-architecture), [DORA metrics](#dora-metrics). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### God Class

A God Class (also an object, component, interface etc) is a class that **knows too much or does too much**; it's an anti-pattern where a single class becomes overly complex, bloated, and takes on too many responsibilities (hence significantly strengthening **tight coupling**), violating the Single Responsibility Principle and making the codebase harder to maintain, test, and understand; e.g. a **User class being reused across various different modules**, yet supporting all of them, thus knowing a little bit about each module, eventually being unmanageable because of tight coupling.

See: [Anti-patterns](#anti-patterns), [Bounded Context](#bounded-context), [Domain Model](#domain-model), [Legacy Code](#legacy-code). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of web communication, defining how clients (like browsers) and servers exchange information over the internet, using requests and responses to retrieve or send data, typically operating over TCP and supporting methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for interacting with resources.

See: [Network Protocols](#network-protocols), [Web Services](#web-services), [Client-Server Model](#client-server-model), [REST](#rest-representational-state-transfer), [SOAP](#soap-simple-object-access-protocol), [RPC](#rpc-remote-procedure-call), [Webhook](#webhook). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Isolate Failure

Isolating failure is about **preventing a single failure from cascading**, even from taking the whole system down; it is a design principle that aims to contain and limit the impact of failures by isolating components, services, or processes, to prevent them from affecting the entire system, ensuring that failures are contained and do not propagate.

See: [Resilience](#resilience), [Defensive Programming](#defensive-programming), [Fault Tolerance](#fault-tolerance), [Microservices](#microservices). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### TTM (Time To Market)

Time To Market (TTM) describes how fast can you ship stuff; it's the time it takes to develop and launch a new product or feature, from the initial idea to its availability to customers, and is a critical factor in a company's success, as it directly impacts competitiveness, revenue, and market share.

See: [MVP](#mvp-minimum-viable-product). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Underfetching

Underfetching happens when an API doesn't provide enough data in a single request, requiring the client to make additional requests to fetch the necessary information, leading to performance issues and increased latency, commonly seen in REST APIs when the response doesn't include all required data for a specific view or business operation.

See: [Web Services](#web-services), [GraphQL](#graphql), [Overfetching](#overfetching), [REST](#rest-representational-state-transfer), [Performance](#performance), [HTTP](#http-hypertext-transfer-protocol), [Latency](#latency). ðŸ‘‰ [back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Unknown Unknowns

_Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, **there are known knowns**; there are things we know we know. We also know there are **known unknowns**; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also **unknown unknowns** â€” the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones._
