Imagine a situation where you find some *really bad code* ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and/or a *very crappy solution* ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. You decide to rewrite it, sometimes involving your teammates. As you progress with the new solution you find out there were some **very important aspects** you **weren't aware of** ü§®, which were affecting the solution. You have that feeling, knowing that something bad has already happened ü´£.

Now, as you take these important "new" information into account, the new solution is getting more and more similar to the existing one. The one you thought was so bad. Initially you thought the original code author was simply incompetent. But now it turns out **it's you, who wasted time on a refactor that didn't meet the goals**.

Ok, but so what?

# Why documenting decisions?

Each day we're **making decisions** related to the software projects we're working on. They are of **different importance**: some are rather **irrelevant** and we might even forget them after a week - but others could be absolutely **critical**, would affect the success of the project (or lack of thereof) and be difficult to change later. Some are **architectural decisions** (*higher-level*, closer to business), whereas others are **technical decisions** (*lower-level*, closer to the code).

As long as the decisions are rather recent, we can easily recall the context the entire reasoning behind it, the advantages and disadvantages we've considered, and even alternative decisions we took into account. The fact that we took part in the decision making helps in bringing up the context later.

But what if we're joining an existing project, especially a long-running one, where a **questionable decision** has been made? We can see some of its consequences, but we're lacking the **WHY** behind it. We don't know what alternatives were considered. We don't know what were the pros and cons. And, most importantly, we have no clue if there is an important aspect that we have overlooked, and which **pushed this exact decision to be made**.

It could be also going back to our own decision, just after 2 years or so. Again, just not remembering the important aspects and the whole context.

That's where ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) come to play.

# What is an ADR

ADR is - basically - a documentation of the architectural decisions made in your project:
- just text files, usually stored in a repo for convenience, markdown/asciidoc, whatever
- they relate to **architectural decisions** (**not technical ones**)
- they should be **short and concise**.

The point of ADR is to quickly bring back the context behind a decision - not to become a novelist ü§ê.

# WHY over WHAT

When discussing design and architecture, the **WHY** is often way more important than the **WHAT**. **WHY**? üòâ
- because we can see **WHAT** was decided, often by looking at the codebase
- the **WHY** is what is either very difficult to spot in the codebase, or even impossible
- not to mention that the considerations which affected the decision are outdated, no longer valid, so the decision could have been different, if made today. But **how can we know, if nobody wrote the WHY**?
