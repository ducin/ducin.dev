This document briefly describes dozens of **important software architecture** topics, terms, acronyms, strategies, characteristics, and so on. It shows the **relations** between them and outlines **how endlessly interdisciplinary Software Architecture is**.

## Motivation

Why writing yet another pile of descriptions? ğŸ¤”

There's a quite a lot of high quality materials out there (as well as low quality, unfortunately). But software architecture is a multi-disciplinary field that integrates the knowledge from various domains... and when you want to learn one concept, 3 new ones pop up! Each of these bring more and more concepts we should learn first. And as we go down the rabbit hole, we get to [know our unknowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_unknown_unknowns). **But this can be intimidating**.

The purpose of this Pocketbook is to introduce each term in **the simplest possible form**.

**Each definition is just 1 sentence.** It's very far from a detailed analysis, it doesn't cover all possible usecases, especially it doesn't cover edge cases. It's just a very high-level description, often including the **WHY**: why would someone use a certain tool or adapt a technique.

I believe this will make it easier for developers to **enter the world of Software Architecture** in a less painful.

I hope that below you'll find lots of **inspirations for further learning**.

Enjoy the read!
