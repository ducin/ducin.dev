### HTTP

From JS perspective, HTTP is asynchronous (since the callback would be executed after some time, but we register it upfront, no matter the API). And signals are capable of sync processing only.

But this **doesn't change the fact**, that an **HTTP response is a value**. It's just **available after some time**. On one hand we could squash it into a sync signal by providing an immediate initial value (available before response arrives). Or we could make it resemble promises more (status: `pending`, `fulfilled`, `rejected`) or even [async iterables](https://jakearchibald.com/2017/async-iterators-and-generators/) if there might be more than one value available.
