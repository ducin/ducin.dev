These are some of the quotes that I found interesting, related to software, software architecture and software design.

Have a good read 🙂.

----

> Defer the actual decision until a decision can be made more responsibly, based on actual knowledge, but not so late that it is not possible to take advantage of the knowledge.

― Richard Monson-Haefel

----

> You don‘t drive the architecture, the requirements do. You do your best to serve their needs.

― Richard Monson-Haefel

----

> Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves.

- Tim Berners-Lee

----

> Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.

- Fred Brooks

----

> Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.

- Cyril Northcote Parkinson

----

> Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.

- Jon Postel

----

> Make it work, make it right, make it fast.

― Kent Beck

----

> Testing is not the point. The point is about responsibility.

― Kent Beck

----

> Sometimes the problem has to mature before the solution can mature.

― Kent Beck

----

> If testing costs more than not testing, then don't test.

― Kent Beck

----

> An antipattern is just like a pattern, except that instead of a solution it gives something that looks superficially like a solution but isn't one.

- Andrew Koenig

----

> Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence.

- Edsger W. Dijkstra

----

> Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better.

― Edsger W. Dijkstra

----

> Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability.

― Edsger W. Dijkstra

----

> If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.

― Edsger W. Dijkstra

----

> No matter what they tell you, it's always a people problem.

― Gerald Weinberg

----

> A system is never finished being developed until it ceases to be used.

― Gerald Weinberg

----

> The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it's to post the wrong answer.

― Ward Cunningham

----

> What's the simplest thing that could possibly work?

― Ward Cunningham

----

> Simple, not easy. There's a difference.

― Ron Jeffries

----

> If there's only one answer, then this must not be a very interesting topic.

― Ron Jeffries

----

> To change the architecture of a software-intensive system ensconced in a large organization, you often have to change the architecture of the organization. And ultimately, that is a political problem, not just a technical one.

― Grady Booch

----

> All architecture is design, but not all design is architecture.
> Architecture represents the set of significant design decisions that shape the form and the function of a  system, where significant is measured by cost of  change.

― Grady Booch

----

> The amateur software engineer is always in search of magic.

― Grady Booch

----

> Hierarchy is a kind of order of abstractions.

― Grady Booch

----

> Architectural decisions are design decisions that are hard to make or costly to change.

― Olaf Zimmermann

----

> All architectures become iterative because of unknown unknowns, Agile just recognizes this and does it sooner.

― Mark Richards

----

> I've learned to always avoid saying "always".

― Martin Fowler

----

> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.

― Martin Fowler

----

> So I hope I’ve made clear that imposing agile methods is a very red flag.

― Martin Fowler

----

> I would rather have questions that can't be answered than answers that can't be questioned.

― Richard Feynman

----

> I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.

― Richard P. Feynman

----

> Religion is a culture of faith; science is a culture of doubt.

― Richard P. Feynman

----

> Stupidity is knowing the truth, seeing the truth but still believing the lies.
> And that is more infectious than any other disease.

― Richard P. Feynman

----

> The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.

― Richard P. Feynman

----

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.

― Phil Karlton

> Architecture is about the important stuff (whatever that is).

― Ralph Johnson

----

> Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones.

― Donald Rumsfeld

----

> The only source of knowledge is experience.

― Albert Einstein

----

> If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.

― Albert Einstein

----

> Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.

― Albert Einstein

----

> Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

― Albert Einstein / Rita Mae Brown
